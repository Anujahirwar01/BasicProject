## Getting Started

To get a local copy of StackZone up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** installed (LTS version recommended)
* **MongoDB** installed and running
* An **OpenAI API Key**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repositories:**

    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        git clone <URL_TO_YOUR_BACKEND_REPO> StackZone-Backend
        cd StackZone-Backend
        ```
    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        git clone <URL_TO_YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO> StackZone-Frontend
        cd StackZone-Frontend
        ```
    *(**Note:** Replace `<URL_TO_YOUR_BACKEND_REPO>` and `<URL_TO_YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO>` with the actual URLs if your backend and frontend are in separate repositories. If they are in the same monorepo, adjust these steps accordingly to navigate to the correct subdirectories.)*

2.  **Install NPM packages for both Backend and Frontend:**

    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd StackZone-Backend
        npm install
        ```
    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        cd StackZone-Frontend
        npm install
        ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    * **Backend (`StackZone-Backend/.env`):**
        Create a `.env` file in your backend root directory and add:
        ```
        MONGO_URI=<YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING>
        JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY>
        OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
        PORT=5000 # Or any port you prefer for the backend
        ```
        * Get your **MongoDB connection string** from MongoDB Atlas or your local instance.
        * Generate a **strong, random string** for `JWT_SECRET`.
        * Obtain your **OpenAI API Key** from your OpenAI dashboard.

    * **Frontend (`StackZone-Frontend/.env`):**
        Create a `.env` file in your frontend root directory and add:
        ```
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Or your backend's URL
        ```
        * Ensure `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` points to where your backend server will be running.

4.  **Run the applications:**

    * **Start the Backend Server:**
        Open a new terminal, navigate to the `StackZone-Backend` directory, and run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        *(Or `node server.js` depending on your backend's main file)*

    * **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
        Open another new terminal, navigate to the `StackZone-Frontend` directory, and run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
        The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).
